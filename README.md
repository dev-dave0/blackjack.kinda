# blackjack.kinda
A text based Blackjack game - Supports the basic rules of the card game Blackjack (some in-game options such as splits not supported in this version)

The goal of this project was to challenge myself by creating a program that included some of the major concepts that I've learned in my coding journey 
thus far. By creating this project, I was able to test my understanding of each concept while problem solving throughout the creation process.

Some of the concepts I focused on included basic data structures, classes, modules, for/while loops, and error/exception handling. I feel that by working 
with each of these concepts and being forced to problem solve when things didn't work the way I wanted them to, it helped me gain a better understanding 
of the Python language in general and increased my comfortability in working with each concept.

While lacking in some in-game rules and functionality, I felt that this program in it's curent state was sufficent to showcase a basic understanding 
of some of the core concepts of the Python language.


Thank you to everyone who took the time to read through my code.  YOU_ALL == ("AWESOME!")
